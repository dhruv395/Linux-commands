"Ulimit" which allows you to display and set resource limits for users. The systems resources are defined in a file called
"/etc/security/limits.conf 

 To display the "Max user Processes", you could issue the command:
 ulimit -u 

 The hard limit is set by the "root" user or a user with the appropriate escalated privileges. This limit can not be exceeded.  
The soft limit is also set by the "root" user, however, this limit can be overridden by a user using the "ulimit" command. 

 
You can check the current value for opened files with the following command: 
<https://www.tecmint.com/increase-set-open-file-limits-in-linux/>  
$ cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max 

to increase open file limit toâ€¯500000, you can use the following command as root: 
# sysctl -w fs.file-max=500000 
 

Temporary 
# vi /etc/sysctl.conf 
 
Permanent 
fs.file-max=500000 

 Add the line: 
# sysctl -p
