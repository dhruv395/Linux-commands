SUID-SetUID 
----------------- 
Setuid allows a user to run an executable file with the permission of the file owner 

Setting UID  

chmod u+s file.txt 

Numerical method: chmod 4750 file.txt 

-rwS --- --- -->  Setuid , No execute permission 

-rws --- --- --> Setuid + execute permission 

-rwx --- --- --> No set uid , execute permission 

Example:- passwd command 

#ll /usr/bin 

-rwsr-xr-x. 1 root root       27832 Jun 10  2014 passwd 

If we run the passwd command , generally it modifies the /etc/shadow file for updating the passwd. But normal user don't have any permission over it. Because of setting SUID, the passwd command is always run as root user . 

 SGID-SetGID 
------------------ 

Similar to SUID 

Works on directories 

File ownership is normally based on who created that file 

In SGID directory files are owned by the group owner of the directory ... 

Ie, group owner of the files will be same as the group owner of the SGID Directory 

Setting GID 

#chmod g+s directory 

Numerical method : chmod 2000 directory 

d--- --S --- --> SetGID, No execute permisiion 

d--- --s --- --> SetUGID , Execute permission 

D--- --x --- --> No SGID , execute permisiion 

 
Sticky Bit 
------------- 
Sticky bit is used on folders to avoid file deletion by users who have write permisiion 

When sticky bit is enabled , 

Owner of file can delete it 

Owner of directoy can delete it 

Root can delete it 

Enable Sticky bit 

#chmod o+t directory 

#chmod 1000 directory 

D--- --- --T -->  Sticky bit + No execute permission 

D--- --- --t --> Sticky bit + execute permission 

 
Blocking SUID over a filesystem 
------------------------------------------ 
#mount -o nosuid /dev/xvdb1
